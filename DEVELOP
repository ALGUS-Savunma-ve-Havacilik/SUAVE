If you would like to develop for SUAVE, here are a few tips
to setup your local repo.

# Developer install
See the INSTALL file for instructions on doing a developer
install.  This will let you install a link to SUAVE in your
python's site-packages, so that you don't have to re-install
with every change you make to the code.

# "/workspace/" directory
SUAVE's .gitignore allows you to create a "workspace" 
directory, in the home folder (the same folder that contains 
trunk, doc, etc..).  In here you can work on test scripts,
and store your IDE's project files here.
